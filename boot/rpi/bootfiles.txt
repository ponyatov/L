bin files from: https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware

When the Raspberry Pi is first turned on, the ARM core is off, and the GPU core
is on. At this point the SDRAM is disabled.

The GPU starts executing the first stage bootloader, which is stored in ROM on
the SoC. The first stage bootloader reads the SD card, and loads the second
stage bootloader (bootcode.bin) into the L2 cache, and runs it.

bootcode.bin
	https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/raw/master/boot/bootcode.bin
	
bootcode.bin initializes the SDRAM in the SoC, and loads the third stage
loader from start.elf into main memory (this binary contains the GPU firmware
as well)

start.elf	
	https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/raw/master/boot/start.elf
	
start.elf reads the file config.txt and configures the system accordingly.

start.elf reads a kernel command line from cmdline.txt and a kernel image
from kernel.img

the GPU passes control to the ARM CPU which starts executing the kernel
